		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi there, I'm Sarah. I am passionate about how users and technology interact. I love making things work and translating complex ideas into simple, logical designs.
		<br><br>
		After my undergraduate as a bioengineering major at UPenn, I went on to a career in graphic design. I'm looking to join a product-focused organization that is dedicated to developing great products that people love interacting with. In this tech world, programming is what drives innovation, and with the help of Startup Institute, I want to become a part of that driving factor.</p>
